# Prabandak
This was one of my very first project which i worked upon after getting into my college.<br>
The idea behind this project was to make the students know about how data is stored and managed by various big companies in servers. <br>
I have used Xampp server on my localhost and php admin to manage the database and store the data in the respective tables.<br>
Once you have this cloned you have to then connect it with a xampp server and make the database.<br>
Once you have logged in you will be seeing a page/success page.
